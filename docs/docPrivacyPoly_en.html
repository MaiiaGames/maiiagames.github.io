    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><span class="bold">Last updated:</span> June 12, 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the games developed by <span class="bold">Luis Carlos Lima</span>, Independent Developer, handle information within the context of gameplay. Our goal is to be transparent.</p>

    <h2>1. Data collection and use for personalized ads</h2>
    <p>
    Our games use Google AdMob, Google's advertising platform, to display ads that help keep the games free. With your consent, AdMob may collect certain information — such as your approximate location and advertising ID — to display personalized and more relevant ads. This data is used solely for advertising and analytics purposes, aiming to improve your experience with the ads. You can change your consent preferences at any time in the game's privacy settings. If you choose not to consent, only non-personalized ads will be shown, without using your personal data. For more information, see Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you have any questions about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:maiiagames@proton.me">maiiagames@proton.me</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Data sharing with third parties</h2>
    <p>
    We, as developers, do not collect or store personal data directly. However, third-party services integrated into the game — such as Google AdMob — may collect and process certain information with your consent, including approximate location or device identifiers. This data is used solely for personalized advertising and is not accessed or used by us.
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-app purchases</h2>
    <p>
    Some of our games offer in-app purchases. These purchases are processed exclusively by the responsible platforms (such as <span class="bold">Google Play</span> or the <span class="bold">App Store</span>). We do not collect, store, or have access to any financial information, payment data, or personal data related to these transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
    Our games are not intended for users under the age of 14. We, as developers, do not collect or store any personal data from users, regardless of age.

    However, depending on the user’s consent, Google AdMob — the advertising platform used in the game — may collect limited information (such as approximate location) to display ads. These practices are the responsibility of Google and are subject to their privacy policy.

    We recommend that parents or guardians supervise children’s use of devices and review the available privacy settings on the operating system and Google accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Legal compliance</h2>
    <p>
    This Privacy Policy complies with the <span class="bold">General Data Protection Law (LGPD)</span> and other applicable legislation. Since we do not collect or process personal data directly, our data protection obligations are limited. However, we remain committed to transparency and compliance with all relevant regulations.
    </p>
