    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><span class="bold">Last updated:</span> May 22, 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <span class="bold">Ball Sort Challenge</span>, developed by <span class="bold">Luis Carlos Lima, Independent Developer</span>, handles information in the context of the game. Our goal is to be transparent.</p>

    <h2>1. Data collection and use for personalized ads</h2>
    <p>
      Ball Sort Challenge uses AdMob, an advertising platform, to display ads that help keep the game free.
      With your consent, AdMob may collect certain information — such as your approximate location — to show more relevant and personalized ads.
      This data is used exclusively to improve your ad experience.
      You can change your consent preferences at any time in the game settings.
      If you do not agree, only non-personalized ads will be shown, without the use of your personal data.
      For more information, please refer to AdMob's Privacy Policy:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:maiiagames@proton.me">maiiagames@proton.me</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Data sharing with third parties</h2>
    <p>
      We, as developers, do not collect or store personal data directly. However, third-party services integrated into the game — such as AdMob — may collect and process certain information with your consent, including approximate location or device identifiers. This data is used solely for the purpose of displaying personalized ads and is not accessed or used by us.
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-app purchases</h2>
    <p>
      Ball Sort Challenge offers in-app purchases. These transactions are managed exclusively by the stores (such as <span class="bold">Google Play</span> or <span class="bold">App Store</span>).
      We do not have access to any information related to these transactions, such as payment data or user identification.
    </p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
Ball Sort Challenge is suitable for users aged 9 and older. We, as developers, do not collect or store any personal data from users, regardless of age.  
However, depending on user consent, AdMob — the advertising platform used in the game — may possibly collect limited information (such as approximate location) to display ads. These practices are the responsibility of Google and are subject to their privacy policy.  
We recommend that parents or guardians supervise children's use of devices and review the available privacy settings in the operating system and Google accounts.
</p>



    <h2>5. Legal compliance</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy complies with the <span class="bold">General Data Protection Law (LGPD)</span> and other applicable legislation.
      As we do not collect or process personal data directly, our data protection obligations are limited. However, we remain committed to transparency and compliance with all relevant regulations.
    </p>
